      <div class="lyrics">
        <p class="verse">When you try your best, but you don't succeed</p>
        <p class="verse">When you get what you want, but not what you need</p>
        <p class="chorus">When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep</p>
        <p class="chorus">Stuck in reverse</p>
        <p class="verse">And the tears come streaming down your face</p>
        <p class="verse">When you lose something you can't replace</p>
        <p class="chorus">When you love someone, but it goes to waste</p>
        <p class="chorus">Could it be worse?</p>
        <p class="bridge">Lights will guide you home</p>
        <p class="bridge">And ignite your bones</p>
        <p class="bridge">And I will try to fix you</p>
